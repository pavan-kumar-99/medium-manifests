# GitHub Actions 

Automating Kubernetes Cluster creation and Bootstrapping using GitHub Actions
GitHub Actions allows you to design your CI and CD workflows directly in your GitHub repositories. GitHub actions are entirely integrated with GitHub. Build, Test, and Deploy can be done directly from GitHub. So your CI/CD workflows can be at the same place where your source code exists. The CI/CD Pipeline can be triggered with events like pull requests or merging of branches etc. In this article, we will be using the GitHub actions to create a GKE Cluster with terraform and bootstrap the cluster with some tools like Istio and flagger.
